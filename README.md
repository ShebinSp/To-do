# To-do
A CLI tool for managing a list of "to-do" items.
      Unlike with a graphical program, the user of a CLI tool generally provides
up front all the input and parameters required for the tool to work. The tool
uses that input to do its job and provides results back to the user as text
output on the screen. When an error occurs, a CLI tool usually provides
details about it in a way thatâ€™s easy and practical for the user to understand
or potentially filter out.
